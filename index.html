    <h3>Christmas in Mexico:</h3>
    <p>The people of Mexico celebrate Christmas a little bit differently. They celebrate the holiday named: <u>The Day of the Virgin of Guadalupe</u> This holiday takes place 2 weeks before Christmas and it is meant to celebrtate Mary, Jesus's Mother. On this day, The children in Mexico dress up. They play music and dace as well as pray and lay flowers around Marys's statue</p>
    <p>Another holiday that is celebrated in Mexico is: <u>Posadas.</u> Posadas is celebrated from December 16th to the 24th. This holiday is representing Mary and Joseph looking for a place to rest while they are on their way to Bethlehem. Children dress up as shepherds or angels and each night from the 16th to the 24th they knock on doors asking to spend the night until one allows them to. Once the are in their place for the night they eat food, play songs, pray and play a round of pi√±ata. On the last night of the holiday they all set off fireworks and ring the church bells. They all eat large feasts. Some of the food they eat are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tamales</li>
        <li>Churros</li>
        <li>Pozole</li>
        <li>Ensalada Nochebuena</li>
    </ul>
